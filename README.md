To start this project users have to build predictive models encompasses a series of intricate steps, including data preparation, rigorous data quality checks, feature reduction, model building, predictive analysis, and critical examination of model outcomes. 
Users can get help with our project by following the steps, and procedures in building the model for optimal performance and reducing potential risks of the analytics model.
